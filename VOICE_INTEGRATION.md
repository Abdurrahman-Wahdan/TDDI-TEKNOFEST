## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Quick Demo (No Extra Installs)

```bash
# From TDDI-TEKNOFEST directory
python launch_voice_app.py

# Or directly:
cd streamlit_app
streamlit run demo_app.py
```

### Option 2: Full Voice Features

```bash
# Install voice packages
pip install torch numpy transformers faster-whisper TTS pyaudio webrtcvad

# Run full voice app
cd streamlit_app
streamlit run simple_voice_app.py
```

### Option 3: Advanced Real-time Voice

```bash
# Run the setup script
./run_voice_app.sh

# Or manually:
cd streamlit_app
streamlit run tddi_voice_app.py
```

## 🎯 Features Integrated

### ✅ Working Now

- **💬 Text Chat**: Fully integrated with TDDI workflow
- **📱 Web Interface**: Clean Streamlit UI
- **🗂️ Conversation History**: Track all interactions
- **🎤 Voice Upload**: Upload audio files for processing
- **🔊 Voice Output**: Text-to-speech responses

### 🔄 Available After Installing Voice Packages

- **🎙️ Real-time Recording**: Live voice detection
- **🗣️ Voice Cloning**: Use custom speaker voices
- **⚡ Auto-play**: Automatic response playback
- **🔇 Smart Muting**: Prevents feedback during playback

## 🛠️ Technical Integration

### Workflow Connection

The voice apps now directly use your TDDI-TEKNOFEST workflow:

```python
from workflow import create_turkcell_workflow
workflow = create_turkcell_workflow()
response = await workflow.ainvoke(initial_state)
```

### Voice Pipeline

```
Audio Input → Whisper STT → TDDI Workflow → XTTS TTS → Audio Output
```

### Fallback System

- If voice packages aren't installed → Text-only mode
- If workflow fails → Demo responses
- If models fail → Graceful error handling

## 🎤 Voice Models Included

### Speech-to-Text (STT)

- **Model**: faster-whisper (configurable size)
- **Language**: Turkish optimized
- **Features**: File upload + real-time recording

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)

- **Model**: XTTS v2 multilingual
- **Voice Cloning**: Uses your `nicesample.wav`
- **Quality**: High-quality natural speech

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Test the Demo

```bash
python launch_voice_app.py
```

Visit: http://localhost:8501

### 2. Install Voice Features

```bash
pip install -r streamlit_app/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Settings

Edit `streamlit_app/config.py`:

- Model sizes
- Audio settings
- Feature toggles
- File paths

### 4. Customize Voice

Replace `audio_files/nicesample.wav` with your own voice sample for voice cloning.

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Model Settings

```python
STT_MODEL_SIZE = "base"  # tiny, base, small, medium, large
TTS_MODEL = "tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v2"
DEVICE = "cpu"  # or "cuda" for GPU
```

### Feature Toggles

```python
ENABLE_VOICE_FEATURES = True
ENABLE_REAL_TIME_RECORDING = True
AUTO_PLAY_RESPONSES = True
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Voice Features Not Working?

1. Install audio packages: `pip install pyaudio webrtcvad`
2. Check microphone permissions
3. Try file upload instead of recording
4. Use smaller models if memory issues

### Workflow Errors?

1. Test individual workflow components
2. Check imports and dependencies
3. Use demo mode as fallback

### Performance Issues?

1. Use smaller models (`tiny` instead of `medium`)
2. Switch to CPU-only mode
3. Reduce audio quality settings

## 🎉 Success!

Your TDDI-TEKNOFEST project now has:

- ✅ Complete voice integration
- ✅ Web interface
- ✅ Fallback systems
- ✅ Easy deployment
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
